$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grow-a-garden-bot.git
$ cd grow-a-garden-bot
```

2. Install Dependencies

```$ pip install discord.py requests```

3. Configure the Bot

Edit the config.py file:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN = "your_discord_bot_token"

CHANNEL_IDS = {
    channelid1: "Stock",
    channelid2: "Weather",
    channelid3: "Egg Stock",
    channelid4: "Honey Stock"
}

NTFY_TOPIC = "your-ntfy-topic-name"
```

##### Replace "your_discord_bot_token" with your bot's token.

## 🚀 Run the Bot

```python main.py```

## 🔔 How Notifications Work

Items in default_priority_items or high_priority_items will trigger a notification.

Notifications are sent to your ntfy.sh topic.

High-priority items will use a higher notification level.
